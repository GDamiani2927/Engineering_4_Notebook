## Launchpad Part 1

### Assignment Description

The object of this assignment was to use circuitpython and a Pico to countdown from 10 to 0 (Liftoff) in the console. To do this, we used a for loop to decrement once every second.

### Code

### Reflection

This was a little bit tricky for a couple reasons. The first was that I ran into multiple issues with importing the board, but what I know understand is that we aren't writing in python (which is what I thought), but instead **circuit python**. Once I understood this, the process became a lot clearer. Another problem I ran into was not actually knowing python. Luckily, my best friend google helped me very kindly with this issue.

## Launchpad Part 2

### Assignment Description

The object of this assignment was to use circuitpython and a Pico to countdown from 10 to 0 (Liftoff) in the console and blink a red LED every second of the countdown and use a green LED to indicate liftoff.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
